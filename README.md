This is a project of Face Reconstruction by using Eigenfaces and Principal Component Analysis
The idea of Eigenface was introduced in M. A Turk and A. P. Pentland, “Face Recognition Using Eigenfaces", Proceedings of IEEECVPR 1991.

This Jupiter notebook is detail explanations of the approach of reconstruction by using Eigenface. Future implementation includes face detection, face recognitions and so on.
Unzip "trainingface.zip" and put it in the folder called “trainingface” to obtain the training data. There are 200 neutral faces and 200 corresponding smiling faces.
